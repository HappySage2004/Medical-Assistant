{"rating": 2.0, "snippet": "A poorly thought-out store with poor stock control and shabby practices in a badly designed retail park.\n\nThis supermarket was built in an area known officially as a \"Green Travel District\".   However, whilst the cycle parking sheltered under an overhang right outside the store entrance is good, and there is car-free access via the canal (a cycling and walking route), that's where the good practice ends.   The path used for this connection with the canal is made of sand, and is therefore very messy, and in places tricky to cycle.   It's also rather narrow for shared-use, but for me the alternatives normally represent a detour, one of which is via the undercroft car park, an area that is dark and fume-filled, and therefore not conducive to safe and pleasant cycling.   The sand path continues on as far as the Sainsbury's petrol station (a facility not generally required by people walking, wheeling, and cycling), where it effectively ends at a zebra crossing.   Between this point and the main road there is a detour around the petrol station, so people have been making their own, more direct paths.   Rather than being formalised, these have been blocked off with fences, though those who are able now climb over one of them.   Inside and outside the car park, a jam of honking cars regularly forms, earning the retail park the nickname \"Carmageddon\".   This is the inevitable consequence of building a US-style, car-centric retail park on a relief road, something that has been known as a really bad idea since long before this example was built.\n\nThe supermarket has been raised above ground to maximise the car parking, maximising the induced demand to drive, and minimising the convenience of accessing the shop floor.   Access is via two slow lifts, a steep flight of stairs, or a pair of slow travelators that burn electricity 24/7 in the Green Travel District, and which regularly break down.   At the time of writing, one of the travelators has been out of service for weeks.   Don't be surprised if when you get upstairs there are no trolleys.   This is hardly surprising because with no \"up\" travelator there will be fewer customers taking a trolley upstairs for themselves, and getting the trolleys upstairs is harder for the person who is paid to do the job.\n\nHaving finally made it to the shop floor, you'll find that in theory there is a good selection.   However, things often disappear from the shelves for weeks at a time (gaps on the shelves being quite common), and it's common for fruit and veg to expire on the day you buy it.   And this isn't a theoretical expiry, as the expiry date is so tight it's not unusual to find produce that is rotten on the shelf.   Watch out also for how things are sold.   Spring onions are sold by the bunch, but the difference between bunches is so great that it's sometimes visible (one day I measured one bunch as 100 g, and one bunch as 150 g).   And I've found the identical product for sale at two very different prices in different parts of the store.\n\nSainsbury's are making great play of going plastic free.   However, other than the elimination of single-use bags for loose produce, I can't say I've seen much change.   Indeed mushrooms used to be routinely available loose, but now they often have to be bought in a plastic punnet wrapped in cling film, a practice that not only results in unnecessary plastic waste, but which is also recognised as causing food waste.  At least they have stopped using ugly black, unrecyclable punnets.\n\nAlthough the in-store problems could be fixed with better management, the rest can only be fixed by bulldozing this two-year old retail park and starting again."},

{"rating": 2.0, "snippet": "A poorly thought-out store with poor stock control and shabby practices in a badly designed retail park.\n\nThis supermarket was built in an area known officially as a \"Green Travel District\".   However, whilst the cycle parking sheltered under an overhang right outside the store entrance is good, and there is car-free access via the canal (a cycling and walking route), that's where the good practice ends.   The path used for this connection with the canal is made of sand, and is therefore very messy, and in places tricky to cycle.   It's also rather narrow for shared-use, but for me the alternatives normally represent a detour, one of which is via the undercroft car park, an area that is dark and fume-filled, and therefore not conducive to safe and pleasant cycling.   The sand path continues on as far as the Sainsbury's petrol station (a facility not generally required by people walking, wheeling, and cycling), where it effectively ends at a zebra crossing.   Between this point and the main road there is a detour around the petrol station, so people have been making their own, more direct paths.   Rather than being formalised, these have been blocked off with fences, though those who are able now climb over one of them.   Inside and outside the car park, a jam of honking cars regularly forms, earning the retail park the nickname \"Carmageddon\".   This is the inevitable consequence of building a US-style, car-centric retail park on a relief road, something that has been known as a really bad idea since long before this example was built.\n\nThe supermarket has been raised above ground to maximise the car parking, maximising the induced demand to drive, and minimising the convenience of accessing the shop floor.   Access is via two slow lifts, a steep flight of stairs, or a pair of slow travelators that burn electricity 24/7 in the Green Travel District, and which regularly break down.   At the time of writing, one of the travelators has been out of service for weeks.   Don't be surprised if when you get upstairs there are no trolleys.   This is hardly surprising because with no \"up\" travelator there will be fewer customers taking a trolley upstairs for themselves, and getting the trolleys upstairs is harder for the person who is paid to do the job.\n\nHaving finally made it to the shop floor, you'll find that in theory there is a good selection.   However, things often disappear from the shelves for weeks at a time (gaps on the shelves being quite common), and it's common for fruit and veg to expire on the day you buy it.   And this isn't a theoretical expiry, as the expiry date is so tight it's not unusual to find produce that is rotten on the shelf.   Watch out also for how things are sold.   Spring onions are sold by the bunch, but the difference between bunches is so great that it's sometimes visible (one day I measured one bunch as 100 g, and one bunch as 150 g).   And I've found the identical product for sale at two very different prices in different parts of the store.\n\nSainsbury's are making great play of going plastic free.   However, other than the elimination of single-use bags for loose produce, I can't say I've seen much change.   Indeed mushrooms used to be routinely available loose, but now they often have to be bought in a plastic punnet wrapped in cling film, a practice that not only results in unnecessary plastic waste, but which is also recognised as causing food waste.  At least they have stopped using ugly black, unrecyclable punnets.\n\nAlthough the in-store problems could be fixed with better management, the rest can only be fixed by bulldozing this two-year old retail park and starting again."},
