{"rating": 2.0, "snippet": "There is a good selection of products for somewhere in central London. The parking is good, and with both of the lifts now functioning it has become a bit more convenient.\n\nIt is however, very outdated inside and looks like a relic from the early 2000's. That itself isn't a problem. The staff that they have are really quite helpful and couldn't say anything more positive about them. It is probably the only reason we choose to shop there.\n\nBut this new system which requires us to have a printed receipt to exit is honestly appalling. I don't like the feeling of being locked into the till area because I have to scan my receipt to exit. This itself is enough for me to not come back again and to use Tesco further down the road instead as I don't think customers should be treated like a thief.\n\nAs a reminder as well, Sainsbury's were positioned as the second most expensive supermarket behind Waitrose last year and the response by Sainsbury's were that we had to use the nectar card and register all our details if we wanted to receive the previous prices before they imitated Tesco club card system."},

{"rating": 5.0, "snippet": "The service here is so lovely. I had a big party over the weekend and had to go back and fourth to this store quiet a lot over the past 2 weeks. The staff there have been exceptional every time. Helping me find what I needed and just during checkout and when I had to exchange some items. Lovely team and a pleasure to visit the store. I hope this message gets back to them!"}, 
{"rating": 3.0, "snippet": "Stock levels are much better than they used to be. Staff (some) are friendly and helpful. I'm not keen on the ones on the customer service desk. I usually find them grumpy and rude. Linda, on the self-service tills is great though.\n\nI like the new system on the self-service tills, where you need to scan your receipt to exit. I've seen a man walk away from there quickly, as he was walking away, the screen was buffering, then when it stopped, it said his card was declined. I hope it is kept and they don't bow down to customer pressure to keep the gate open. Ultimately, those of us that go there to legimately shop and pay for our shopping, will get hit with higher prices, to cover their losses.\n\nManagement need to look again at the abuse of disabled parking and child spaces, which are already so few and few between. For example, Tues 22/4/25, white van occupying disabled space and workers standing around eating lunch. Then they stand gawping across at me watching me park, then scrutinise me walking across the car park entering the store.  It actually puts me off going there as I don't wish to feel intimidated and harassed just going to shop. People need to load up their shopping, then go, not tie up the spaces."}, 
{"rating": 1.0, "snippet": "The staff is amazing however what have you done to the layout!\nNothing makes sense!\nA huge selection of unhealthy sugary drinks! And lots of items that you do not stock anymore! Like Redbush tea and good quality hummus.\nThis is a local residential area that needs to stock cooking essentials.\nThanks"}, 
{"rating": 1.0, "snippet": "Since the store caved in to Euro Car Parks who cut parking from 2hr to 1hr ...which is certainly not enough for a family shop or for the elderly given there's now only 1 lift to the store and it takes forever to go a few feet    (don't use it if you have any form of claustrophobia) the experience is abysmal.Fines galore and Sainsbury's can't even be bothered to arrange a ticket redemption system for their customers as other stores do.\nThey do have a good selection of products but the store looks tired and dilapidated.\nMaybe they are thinking of selling the site and can't be bothered any more.\nCan you read the sign in the pic below ?"},
